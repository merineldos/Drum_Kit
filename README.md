# Drum_Kit

Drum Kit is an interactive web application that simulates a drum set. Users can trigger drum sounds either by clicking on specific drum images or by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it a perfect example to understand the workings of event listeners and callbacks.

## Features:

- Keyboard Interaction: Each drum sound can be triggered by pressing a designated key on the keyboard. The keys used are 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'j', 'k', and 'l'.
- Mouse Interaction: Users can click on images of the drum instruments to produce sounds.
- Responsive Design: The application is styled using CSS to provide a visually appealing and responsive interface.
